you know i complain but you should know by now i dont give a fuck lol...  part of being sorry?? part of mk ultra?? no wonder you dont talk.  what's the flavour of the week bro???

too many tears for every tier.  i put this cost in place or sharky did it to himself that he doesn't exceed his content.  and he has exceeded indeed.  at least you show monees...  i guess... lol...

sooo.  you know when i'm under your influence i think a little bit lol.. i left everything for you to do.  cause i'm not uncooperative...  anyways, i told i don't care but you made it so cause i remember what you did and try to make me lose goals once i leave the building hint hint... more than one brain cell required to decipher this bit.

too difficult.  even for me but you wanted secret lol...  the thing they dont show you is the full 3d image..  get it?? no?? its okay it doesn't matter.  i do this everyday.
