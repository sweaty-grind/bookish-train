so many days passed by and its almost sunny out all the time now...  i wonder more things...  some more things like this and that.  i wonder when this stupid thing is over.  every day i wait but i dont notice.  sorta...

so i feel at lost other than to learn from mistakes dealing with you here.  you don't make fair deals i really can't stand it.  how come you don't pay billions in patent fees???  i dont know man. i ran out of gas or something.  no more power overwhelming.
