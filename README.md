so many things happened in the world while i was away... i feel i dont have a part in society.  why are we doing this again?? this is where it ended and where it ended...

i dont know man.  i feel dumb doing this with you.  i dont know how much more i can pull a cheapskate concept for you dude.  i'm here the whole time...  does nothing...  you do nothing bro.  this is negative productivity.  until we learned this actually did anything at all.  maybe this whole time was a bad dream???
