wow this is confusing...  i dont know anymore myself.  i think you're a whacko for hanging around here too much.  its unnatural...  probably bad for you too..  no?? sure buddy...

lets remember reality as our marbles are starting to come back to me...  i dont know bro. i feel sick...

hmmm. i dont know.  did you release me from this??  for real??  i feel some relief.  ah bah humbug.  its the old stuff...

i dont know man... 

i'm very tired you guys. only drinking 2 of these.  1 down 1 to go...

how come you take forever to get anything done with you guys.  lol wtf we cured this shit a while back already.  oh well.  i gained an appreciation for the present lol...

so i do feel bad eventually i will change to off some drugs...  but its a pain we all must endure.  if i broke the law properly i dont know bro.
