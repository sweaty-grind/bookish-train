i think i figured it out.  this is not supposed to make sense...  but why do i know how well this device of yours is like??  that's not my problem lol...  but it became and i absorb some more stupidity.  i'm sorry i could not reclassify them anything living...  i know that pain every day as a concept you never touch.  like how i dont do shit...

you know what?? i think my words are lethal or something.  who does that kind of shit lol???  that's the name of the game.  communication...

no sir, i did not solve it today other than the fact i know i already solved this problem a while back...

i must say this world would not go round if everyone was like me...  or brain injured... sharkey didnt tell you he's mean and you play his game it makes you stronger...  lol.. somethings like this and that...

so my friend i am drained.  we can no longer do anything of value because you lied too much..  you seem like more of an opportunity than anything really...
