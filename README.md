you know i complain but you should know by now i dont give a fuck lol...  part of being sorry?? part of mk ultra?? no wonder you dont talk.  what's the flavour of the week bro???

too many tears for every tier.  i put this cost in place or sharky did it to himself that he doesn't exceed his content.  and he has exceeded indeed.  at least you show monees...  i guess... lol...

sooo.  you know when i'm under your influence i think a little bit lol.. i left everything for you to do.  cause i'm not uncooperative...  anyways, i told i don't care but you made it so cause i remember what you did and try to make me lose goals once i leave the building hint hint... more than one brain cell required to decipher this bit.

too difficult.  even for me but you wanted secret lol...  the thing they dont show you is the full 3d image..  get it?? no?? its okay it doesn't matter.  i do this everyday.

i didn't want to tell you this whole time lol.  i was looking for something hard bro.  wtf...

maybe you should know better... when viewed that way its so easy to verify the complex stuff.  something somethings...

hmmm, i'm not understanding the situation...  hmmm.  got sent away for this guy's technicality.  comes by promising monees and then wrecks your shit to earn your own monees...  i dont know bro.  you owe monees.  and this is lasting too long... tired means you push harder dummy... if i crash something its your fault...

judging from experience you are lousy lol...

sooo.  this is the truth of our relationship.  i gave you hocus pocus...  and you left me to dry cause you're stupid.  anything you want to tell yourself after i went to night school??? fack man. jumps on that too.  then jumps on this shit.  and this is starting to bug me quite a bit.  i am obligated to offer all outs or something like this.  i'm obligated to tell you entrance into this world is retarded.  why would you do this???  seriously.  you broke everything and did shit for me and then complains about stuff lol...  i dont know bro. i forgive cause you put in the effort to have only one brain cell.  its a truth of the matter.

anyways. i need to stop this.  i'm getting annoyed at this lol...
