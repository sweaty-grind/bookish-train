sigh the end came so soon lol...  i know what this is... its the end... finally over...  you ran out of use to me.  no more reasoning from things because of concepts i could not remember...

it must be nearly over by now.  you don't have range and los for my place...  pink pony girl and you dance at the club...

i dont know what to say.  a little anti climatic..  we couldn't do anything cool cause you're like that.  its okay.  i know of this.  its where i don't do work myself... stalemating kinda.  rules what is fair and such.  still learning off the man...

i dont know sir... we are at this for a long time.  bro i have to save up energy for drinkings monsters...  i'm poop decked...

i wonder sometimes though.  if you are indeed crazy like they say i am.  that we don't do much to achieve any ends.  thereby wasting my time...  so i wished it was beaming land again.  even power overwhelming kept things interesting.  now we dont do anything...

so yeah there was no more to search for here.  its a dead end.  things fell over...  things happened.  everything was wrong.  oh well i guess its time for right right??  i dont know anymore bro.  when the monster can't even start up in your body and is making you sick.

i dont know anymore bro.  we may be hitting another dead end.  you know of these otherwise my situation would be otherwise.  its a little expensive don't you think???
